# zen-operations-proof

Operative research project with Spring Boot, PrimeFaces, CLP-Java, Guava and more

With Linux Debian 9 everything works fine.
On closer inspection, in the system just mentioned, the coinor-clp library is not installed.

Anyway, CLP-Java wraps up the COIN-OR CLP library written in c ++ and platform dependent. Which is why, for future projects, I'll be moving towards native Java libraries.

Thanks.
